## Individual coaching

During a coaching process, you will set outcomes and goals that are meaningful to you. In the sessions, we will explore your strengths, challenges, and resources on the way to achieving desired change. My role as a coach is to be a partner who encourages self-discovery and provides support to you.

Individual coaching is useful if:
- You are a new manager seeking to find your own unique leadership style.
- You are an experienced manager facing change or leadership challenges.
- You want to increase your self-awareness and self-confidence, or take another step in your career.
