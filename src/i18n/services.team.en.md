## Team coaching

Team coaching enhances communication, builds trust, and fosters collaboration, promoting transparency and productivity in a team.

Group or team process, facilitated by a team coach, can be valuable in the following scenarios:
- When the team needs to align on their mission, goals, and work methods (for example, when the team is new or after significant changes in team composition).
- When there is a lack of psychological safety and mutual trust within a team, which prevents open dialogue about expectations and about ways of working.
- When the team feels they are not fully utilizing their potential and aims to work better and more efficiently.

The process of working with a specific team is tailored to the teamâ€™s needs and objectives.
